# Heart Disease Prediction

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease based on various health parameters using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project contains information about patients' age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, and target variable indicating the presence of heart disease.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available in the file `heart_data.csv`.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase involves understanding the data, identifying patterns, and visualizing relationships between variables. Some of the visualizations included in the EDA are:

- Distribution of Age
- Gender Distribution
- Heart Disease Distribution
- Heart Disease by Gender
- Heart Disease by Age
- Distribution of Chest Pain Types
- Distribution of Resting ECG Types
- Distribution of Resting Blood Pressure
- Distribution of Cholesterol
- Distribution of Maximum Heart Rate Achieved

## Model Building and Prediction

For model building and prediction, the following steps are followed:

1. Preprocessing: Scaling numerical features and encoding categorical features.
2. Train/Test Split: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Model Training: Training many models and comaparing between them suh as `Neural Networks, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest`.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance on the testing data.
